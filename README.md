# AI_project_02

Game written in python using game AI techniques such as goal driven behaviour and steering behaviours.
Also flood algorythm constructed graph used for path planning by means of "dijkstra algorithm" and "A-star algorithm".
All players are implemented with simple AI.
Goal of players is surviving and killing opponents. They try to make decisions based on current needs. They can search for weapon or health or chase opponents and shoot them.
Project based on book Programming game AI by example by Mat Buckland.
